Good job finishing your project. I did not get a video from you so I cannot comment about whether the project works exactly correct, but the code looks like you learned how to implement a lot of things you learned in Python/Java into C++. Itâ€™s not easy to learn a new language and do something useful with it right away, so you should be proud of yourself for being able to do this.
